      4. Now a set of instructions will be visible to you on the screen for
      setting up you project for github. We will be going through all of them.
      The instructions page will look like as shown in the picture below

      5. Open the terminal in your project folder and type command "git init" to
      initialize the project for github

      6. Then we have to give the local project the path of the github repo
      where we want to store our code. The is done by typing the command "git
      remote add origin git@github.com:WAQAR4/bsef18a521-vcs-implementation.git"
      where "git@github.com:WAQAR4/bsef18a521-vcs-implementation.git" is the
      path of my github repo that I just created
    </p>

    <p>
      7. Now we have to add all our files for pushing to github by typing
      command "git add ." where "." indicates all the files. If you want to add
      individual files, you can write the name of the file instead.
